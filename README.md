Brings Youtube like space bar behaviour to MS Stream

by DRE LABS
This script brings Youtube like space bar behaviour to MS Stream.
Before - space bar press would repeat the last click made via mouse in a video player window, e.g. play/pause, window resize, play speed.
Now - in whole browser window (except textareas) space bar will play/pause video. Mimics Youtube behaviour.
Bugs - sometimes double click of space is needed after mouse click on player window. To be fixed.
