Bring Youtube like space bar behaviour to MS Stream
<h2>Info</h2>
<b>by DRE LABS </b></br>
This userscript brings Youtube like space bar behaviour to MS Stream. </br>
Before - space bar press would repeat the last click made via mouse in a video player window, e.g. play/pause, window resize, play speed. </br>
Now - in whole browser window (except textareas) space bar will play/pause video. Mimics Youtube behaviour. </br>
Bugs - sometimes double click of space is needed after mouse click on player window. To be fixed. </br>
